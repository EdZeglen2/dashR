<p class="text-page">
    The dashR library uses the idea of a container made up of various, application related Contexts. A context is merely an object that contains 
    properties and methods. The basic dashR library has the essential functions in its default Contexts for building applications. 
    Things like basic file and folder access, string manipulation, and system commands are in the default library contexts.
